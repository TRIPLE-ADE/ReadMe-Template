## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

## My process

## 1. Project Planning

- Analyze the project requirements and specifications provided by Frontend Mentor.
- Break down the project into smaller tasks and define the scope of work.
- Determine the technologies and tools to be used, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Set up the project structure and version control system (e.g., Git).

## 2. Design and Styling

- Implement the base HTML structure according to the design.
- Style the app using CSS, ensuring responsiveness and visual appeal.
- Test the design and layout across different devices and screen sizes.

## 3. Fetching Data from API

- Write JavaScript code to fetch data from the API using the `async fetch()`.
- Parse the response data and extract the necessary information.
- Update the UI dynamically with the fetched advice content.

## 4. User Interaction

- Implement event handling for user interactions, such as clicking the dice button.
- Write JavaScript functions to generate and display new advice on button click.
- Update the advice ID and content in the UI accordingly.

## 5. Testing and Debugging

- Test the app's functionality thoroughly, checking for any bugs or errors.
- Debug any issues encountered during testing, ensuring smooth operation.
- Perform cross-browser testing to ensure compatibility across different web browsers.
- Optimize the app's performance and responsiveness.

## 6. Documentation and Deployment

- Document the project's README file, providing an overview, installation instructions, and usage guidelines.
- Add any necessary attribution.
- Deploy the app to a hosting platform or provide instructions for running it locally.
- Test the deployed version to ensure it works as expected in a live environment.

## 7. Final Review and Submission

- Review the completed project, ensuring it meets all the requirements.
- Double-check for any remaining bugs or issues and fix them.
- Submit the project solution to Frontend Mentor for evaluation.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

###:notebook: Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/github_username/repo_name.git
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Enter your API in `config.js`
   ```js
   const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';
   ```

###  :hammer: Build
Write the build Instruction here.
 ### :cactus: Branches

 I use an agile continuous integration methodology, so the version is frequently updated and development is really fast.

1. **`stage`** is the development branch.

2. **`master`** is the production branch.

3. No other permanent branches should be created in the main repository, you can create feature branches but they should get merged with the master.

**Steps to work with feature branch**

1. To start working on a new feature, create a new branch prefixed with `feat` and followed by feature name. (ie. `feat-FEATURE-NAME`)
2. Once you are done with your changes, you can raise PR.

**Steps to create a pull request**

1. Make a PR to `stage` branch.
2. Comply with the best practices and guidelines e.g. where the PR concerns visual elements it should have an image showing the effect.
3. It must pass all continuous integration checks and get positive reviews.

After this, changes will be merged.

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('🎉')
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.**

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
